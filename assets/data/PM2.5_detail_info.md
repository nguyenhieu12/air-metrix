**Concept:** PM2.5, or **particulate matter 2.5**, refers to microscopic particles suspended in the air with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less. These particles are incredibly fine, roughly 30 times thinner than a human hair, making them invisible to the naked eye and allowing them to penetrate deep into the lungs and even reach the bloodstream.

**Origin:** PM2.5 pollution stems from various sources, both natural and human-made:

*   **Natural Sources:** Similar to PM10, natural sources like dust storms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and sea spray can contribute to PM2.5 levels.
    
*   **Human-made Sources:** However, the primary contributors to PM2.5 differ and include:
    
    *   **Fossil fuel combustion:** Burning fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants, and industrial processes releases PM2.5 through incomplete combustion. This is a major source, especially in areas with heavy traffic or reliance on coal-fired power plants.
        
    *   **Industrial activities:** Similar to PM10, activities like mining, quarrying, construction, and certain industrial processes generate significant amounts of PM2.5 dust.
        
    *   **Biomass burning:** The burning of wood, agricultural residue, and other organic matter releases fine particles, contributing to PM2.5 pollution, especially in rural areas.
        

**Harmful Effects:** Due to their even smaller size compared to PM10, PM2.5 particles pose a greater health threat:

*   **Respiratory illnesses:** Even short-term exposure can cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and worsen existing respiratory conditions like asthma. Chronic exposure can lead to lung cancer, bronchitis, and even heart disease.
    
*   **Cardiovascular issues:** Studies show a strong link between chronic PM2.5 exposure and an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases.
    
*   **Other health effects:** Research suggests potential links between PM2.5 exposure and adverse effects on cognitive function, diabetes, and even birth defects.
    

**Prevention:**

*   **Reducing reliance on fossil fuels:** Transitioning towards cleaner energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal power can significantly reduce PM2.5 emissions from power plants and vehicles.
    
*   **Improved emission control technologies:** Implementing stricter regulations and investing in technology like high-efficiency filters and catalytic converters in vehicles and industrial facilities can capture and reduce PM2.5 emissions.
    
*   **Control of open burning:** Implementing regulations and promoting awareness to discourage the open burning of waste materials can significantly reduce PM2.5 pollution.
    
*   **Promoting sustainable transportation:** Encouraging the use of public transportation, cycling, walking, and electric vehicles can significantly reduce PM2.5 emissions from cars and trucks.
