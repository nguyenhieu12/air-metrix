**Concept:** PM10, or **particulate matter 10**, refers to microscopic particles suspended in the air with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less. These particles are so small, roughly 7-8 times thinner than a human hair, that they can easily enter our lungs and even reach the bloodstream.

**Origin:** PM10 pollution stems from various sources, both natural and human-made:

*   **Natural Sources:** Dust storms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and sea spray can naturally contribute to PM10 levels.
    
*   **Human-made Sources:** The major contributors to PM10 pollution include:
    
    *   **Combustion:** Burning fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants, and industrial processes releases PM10 from incomplete combustion.
        
    *   **Industrial activities:** Activities like mining, quarrying, construction, and certain industrial processes generate significant amounts of PM10 dust.
        
    *   **Open burning:** The burning of waste materials like agricultural residue and household garbage contributes heavily to PM10 pollution.
        

**Harmful Effects:** Due to their small size, PM10 particles can bypass the body's natural defenses and penetrate deep into the respiratory system. This can lead to a range of health problems, including:

*   **Respiratory illnesses:** Short-term exposure can cause coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing, while chronic exposure can exacerbate asthma, bronchitis, and even lead to lung cancer.
    
*   **Cardiovascular issues:** PM10 inhalation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases.
    
*   **Other health effects:** Studies suggest links between PM10 exposure and adverse effects on cognitive function, diabetes, and even birth defects.
    

**Prevention:**

*   **Reducing reliance on fossil fuels:** Transitioning towards cleaner energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal power can significantly reduce PM10 emissions from power plants and vehicles.
    
*   **Improved emission control technologies:** Implementing stricter regulations and investing in technology like **filters** and **catalytic converters** in vehicles and industrial facilities can capture and reduce PM10 emissions.
    
*   **Control of open burning:** Implementing regulations and promoting awareness to discourage the open burning of waste materials can significantly reduce PM10 pollution.
    
*   **Dust suppression techniques:** Employing techniques like watering dust-prone areas and covering stockpiles during transportation can help control dust generation from construction sites and other activities.
