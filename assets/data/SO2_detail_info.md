**Concept:** SO2, or **sulfur dioxide**, is a chemical compound with the formula SO₂. It is a colorless gas with a pungent odor, often described as "the smell of burnt matches."

**Origin:** SO2 can arise from both natural and human-made sources:

*   **Natural Sources:** Volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and the decomposition of organic matter can all release SO2 into the atmosphere.
    
*   **Human-made Sources:** The primary source of SO2 pollution is the burning of **fossil fuels** like coal, oil, and gas, particularly those with high sulfur content. Industrial processes like copper smelting and paper production also contribute to SO2 emissions.
    

**Harmful Effects:** While SO2 exposure can irritate the respiratory system, causing coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing, its long-term effects are even more concerning:

*   **Air Pollution:** SO2 is a major component of **smog** and contributes to acid rain, which can damage ecosystems, buildings, and historical monuments.
    
*   **Health Issues:** Chronic exposure to SO2 can lead to respiratory illnesses like asthma, bronchitis, and even heart disease.
    

**Prevention:**

*   **Reducing reliance on fossil fuels:** Transitioning towards cleaner energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal power can significantly reduce SO2 emissions.
    
*   **Improved emission control technologies:** Implementing stricter regulations and investing in technology like **flue gas desulfurization** (FGD) systems in power plants can capture and remove SO2 from emissions before they are released into the atmosphere.
    
*   **Fuel switching:** Shifting towards fuels with lower sulfur content, like natural gas, can help mitigate SO2 emissions.
